# UDP-Client-Server-Calculator
This project implements a UDP client-server model in C where the server acts as a calculator performing basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus) based on the client's input. The server remains active until the client terminates the connection. This version does not include a hash function for data integrity.
